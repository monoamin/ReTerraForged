### **Core Concept**:
The system is based on a hierarchical layering model, where each layer depends on the output of the layer below it. The key layers operate on different spatial resolutions and interact with their surroundings through efficient spatial structures. Heightmap data is decoupled from full chunk generation and stored in an octree, allowing for efficient access, dynamic generation, and modification.

### **Layer Structure**:

#### 1. **ElevationLayer** (Base Heightmap, Stored in Octree, 1:1 Mapping)
   - **Role**: Stores the base heightmap data for terrain elevation. This data is decoupled from the rest of the chunk and stored in an **octree** to allow efficient access and modification. The octree enables fast querying of elevation information and spatial neighbor lookups.
   - **Function**: 
     - At a mapping of 1:1 with the base chunk, this layer holds elevation data that can be dynamically retrieved and updated as needed.
     - The octree enables efficient retrieval of elevation data across multiple layers of resolution, making it easier to access and modify regions of the world at varying levels of detail.
   - **Optimization**: 
     - By storing the heightmap independently from full chunk generation, the system avoids generating unnecessary data. Heightmap data is patched into the chunk dynamically at runtime, reducing the need for pregenerating entire chunks.
     - The octree structure allows efficient range queries for elevation data, ensuring fast access to nearby chunks when needed.

#### 2. **GraphLayer** (Flow Network, ElevationLayer Context, Moore(1) Mapping)
   - **Role**: Computes terrain flow based on the heightmap data, using a **Moore(1) neighborhood** to consider adjacent chunks in the flow direction calculations. This layer generates a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents the flow of water across the terrain.
   - **Function**:
     - Each chunk holds a reference to the terrain flow graph (DAG) based on the heightmap from the ElevationLayer. Flow directions are calculated using the octree's spatial data to ensure smooth transitions across chunks.
     - Graphs are dynamically stitched together as new chunks are generated, ensuring that the river system remains connected globally.
   - **Optimization**:
     - By using the octree to quickly query neighboring heightmaps, the flow calculation process becomes more efficient, allowing the system to scale across large terrain areas.
     - The use of cached flow segments and lazy stitching of graphs minimizes redundant calculations and keeps the system performant.

#### 3. **PathLayer** (Steepest Path Calculation, GraphLayer Context, 1:1 Mapping)
   - **Role**: Identifies the steepest paths (highest cumulative absolute edge weight) within each chunk, which represent the potential river sources and paths. This layer uses the flow network from the GraphLayer to determine the most likely river paths.
   - **Function**:
     - For each chunk, this layer calculates the steepest path using the flow data from the GraphLayer. The result is a subgraph representing the steepest descent from the highest point within each chunk.
     - The steepest path is used to identify river source nodes and track their downstream connections.
   - **Optimization**:
     - This layer benefits from efficient neighbor lookups and flow data retrieval through the octree, reducing the computational overhead of calculating the steepest path across multiple chunks.
     - Path data is cached, and dynamic updates occur as new chunks are generated, ensuring that only relevant paths are recalculated.

#### 4. **RiverNetworkLayer** (Global River Network, PathLayer Context, Neumann(64) Mapping)
   - **Role**: Represents the overall river network by combining paths from individual chunks. This layer operates at a larger spatial scale, considering a **Neumann neighborhood** of radius 64 to ensure long-distance river coherence.
   - **Function**:
     - Each chunk holds a reference to the river paths that pass through it, derived from the PathLayer. Rivers are stitched together into a global river network based on their steepest paths and flow data.
     - The Neumann(64) mapping ensures that rivers connect smoothly over long distances and span multiple chunks, maintaining global coherence.
   - **Optimization**:
     - The octree allows efficient access to heightmap and path data for a large spatial area, ensuring that rivers generated across far-reaching chunks are consistent.
     - Neighboring chunk data is lazily loaded as the player moves through the world, reducing the overhead of generating river paths for distant, unseen regions.

#### 5. **TerrainMaskLayer** (Final Terrain Modification, RiverNetworkLayer Context, 1:1 Mapping)
   - **Role**: Modifies the base terrain by applying river paths as heightmap masks. This layer finalizes the chunk by altering the heightmap with the river network data, ensuring that the rivers are carved into the terrain.
   - **Function**:
     - The heightmap data from the ElevationLayer is modified with river path data from the RiverNetworkLayer to create the final terrain. This process applies a mask that carves out rivers and adjusts the terrain based on the river's flow and steepness.
     - This layer outputs the final chunk terrain with rivers integrated into the landscape.
   - **Optimization**:
     - By using cached heightmap data from the octree, the terrain mask is applied only when the chunk is requested, reducing the need to pregenerate large regions of the world.
     - The octree provides fast access to the relevant heightmap data, allowing efficient terrain modifications across multiple chunks.

### **Chunk Generator Integration**:
The chunk generator taps into this multi-layered system, retrieving prepared chunks with pre-generated river paths and heightmaps. The generator dynamically retrieves the heightmap from the octree and patches it into the chunk during runtime, minimizing the need for full chunk pregeneration.

- **Efficient Caching**: Frequently accessed chunks and heightmaps are cached, allowing the system to respond quickly to player movement. The cache is managed dynamically, with chunks near the player prioritized for pre-generation and distant chunks lazily generated as the player approaches.
  
- **Asynchronous Chunk Generation**: The river generation process, including flow calculations and pathfinding, happens asynchronously. Chunks are generated in the background as the player moves, preventing lag and ensuring smooth gameplay. The heightmap and river data are generated first, with full chunk generation deferred until the player is close.

- **Level of Detail (LOD)**: For distant regions, the system uses a lower level of detail for river generation and terrain modification, loading detailed data only as the player approaches. This helps maintain performance in large worlds.
